## Introduction

The following libraries are commonly used for tasks like classification, regression, clustering, and model evaluation.

library(randomForest)  # Random Forest
library(caret)         # Classification and Regression Training
library(rpart)         # Recursive Partitioning and Regression Trees
library(class)         # K-Nearest Neighbors
library(glmnet)        # Regularized Generalized Linear Models (Lasso/Ridge)
library(caTools)       # Data Splitting and Performance Evaluation
library(e1071)         # Support Vector Machines
library(mclust)        # Model-Based Clustering
library(reticulate)    # R-Python Interface
library(adabag)        # AdaBoost and Bagging

## Libraries

installing and loading the required libraries:

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
# Function to install and load libraries
install_if_missing <- function(pkg) {
  if (!require(pkg, character.only = TRUE)) {
    install.packages(pkg, dependencies = TRUE)
    library(pkg, character.only = TRUE)
  }
}

# List of required libraries
packages <- c("randomForest", "caret", "rpart", "class", "glmnet", "caTools",
              "e1071", "mclust", "reticulate", "adabag")

# Install and load each package
lapply(packages, install_if_missing)
